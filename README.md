# dropwizard-app-twitter-webhook

This is a dropwizard application which has APIs which I am using to create a twitter webhook and use it to receive webhook events via this API.

I have deployed this API in heroku.

Corresponding heroku app - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/webhooks-twitter

The heroku app uses the Procfile to depict how to run this java app
