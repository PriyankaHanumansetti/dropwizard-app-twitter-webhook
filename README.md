# dropwizard-app-twitter-webhook

This is a dropwizard application which has apis which I am using to create a twitter webhook and use it to receive webhook events via this api.

I have deployed this api in heroku to get a public vip address of the webhook.

Corresponding heroku app - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/webhooks-twitter

The heroku app uses the Procfile to depict how to run this java app
